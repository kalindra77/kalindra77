# 👋 Hi, I'm Kalindra

Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Blue Team | DFIR | SOC Operations

I'm passionate about cybersecurity with a strong focus on **Blue Team operations**, particularly **Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)**.
I work comfortably in **Linux environments** and have hands-on experience with SOC tools (e.g, Wazuh SIEM and Suricata IDS), disk forensics, log analysis, network security, and basic penetration testing.

Exploring threat patterns, investigating incidents, and strengthening security posture are areas I truly enjoy.
